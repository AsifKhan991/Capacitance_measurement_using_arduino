# Capacitance_measurement_using_arduino
It is a simple code to measure capacitance using arduino nano.<br>
*Only suitable for measuuring in micro farads range.<br>
*D3 is used to charge up the capcitor without any resistor (you may use some to prevent curent spike), 9.8k resistor is used to discharge the cap while A7 is used to mesaure the capacitor voltage change. D2 is used as switch.
